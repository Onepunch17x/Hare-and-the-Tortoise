once upon a time there was a hare and tortoise. The hare boasted, hes could beat anyone in a race. However the tortoise opposed this, and challenged the hare to a race. One the start of the race, the hare was fast and almost finish however, his pride led him to sleep; thinking that he would beat the tortoise once he has woken up from his slumber. In the end the hare woke up to the tortoise crossing the finish line, he asked the tortoise how he won, but all the tortoise said was... "slow and steady wins the race."
